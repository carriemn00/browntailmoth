# Spring 2023
### Carrie Nguyen

- New dataset from 2022! (Public lands only)
## Visualization
- Indicate Public vs Private lands
- Color by Deciduous Trees
### GIS
- Obtain high quality GIS maps of Waterville area light pollution (NASA; https://www.msgc.org/students/) and leaf-off forest density (NAIP - leaf-off map of Waterville (also GoogleEarth))
  - Calculate population index based on these measures
- ARCGIS image classifier 
  - Use classifier to create layer stack of leaf off and leaf on (deciduous forests and evergreen forests)
- Quantification - Index (Outbreak Density, Proximity to light, Deciduous canopy cover)
- Compare BTM density and forestry data with historical BTM and forestry data
- Interactive visualizations

## Survey
- Implement standardized set of questions for coming year of surveys
  - **Counts of BTM nests**
